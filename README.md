# Adult Income

## About Dataset 

The income dataset was extracted from 1994 U.S. Census database.

An individual's annual incom results from various factors. Intuitvely, it is influenced by the individual's education level, age, gender, occupation, and etc.

## Objective of the Project 

The goal of this machine learning project is to predict whether a person makes over 50K a year or not given their demographic variation. To achieve this, several classification techniques are explored and the random forest model yields to the best prediction result.

After understanding the problem statement, which is To calculate if the individual earns more than 50K dollars annually or less than 50K dollars annually, I make an assumption: the currency is in US dollars, and the period is one year

### Fields

The dataset contains 16 columns

Target filed: Income 

-- The income is divided into two classes: <=50K and > 50K

Number of attributes: 14

-- These are the demographics and other features to describe a person 

We can explore possibility in predicting income level based on the individual's information.

## Limitations & Next steps 

The dataset is heavily white-based, it only can present the white-community not for the entire group in north america
the dataset is collected in 1994, the level of influence for each feature maybe changed during these days.

More research and analysis on exploratory data analysis should be conducted to explore more detailed relationships (for example, classification analysis between income level and each occupation, regression analysis between age and capital-gain/loss etc)
